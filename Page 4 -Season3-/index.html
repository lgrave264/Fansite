To prove his determination, Izuku shows his mother the note from Kota thanking him for being his hero; and as a show of humility, All Might bows his head to the ground to promise Inko he will be a better teacher for Izuku, finally earning her hesitant approval.

There, Tsuyu reveals her conflicted feelings that she was unable to prevent her friends from breaking the rules, and her desire for everything to go back the way it was before.

They were guided by Cementoss, Midnight and Ectoplasm. Inside the gym, while everyone was busy training, All Might appeared and gave each students some advice. Midoriya, who has trouble creating an ultimate move went to the development studio to have his costume altered to support the ligaments of his arms. There together with Iida and Uraraka, they were reunited with support hero Hatsume who was developing her new support items which she eagerly tried on them.

She constantly teases him into going out with her, to which he always quickly declines. The class meets several other students from other schools and the test starts with an elimination exam.

Aizawa appears and commends Midoriya for his deductions, but gives the students a zero for failing to realize that All Might had faked his own death as a ploy to escape.

Unbeknownst to the both of them, the fire that was diverted was close to hitting a downed Shindo before Midoriya intervenes with Full Cowling, and yells at both the students. This snaps Todoroki out of it, as he tries to attack Gang Orca again; only for Inasa to again divert the fire. Gang Orca gets tired of hearing the two bicker and sends them both crashing to the ground. The two students soon both realize the triviality of their arguing and combine their Quirks to trap Gang Orca in a fire spiral. The fire spiral is enough to pick at Gang Orca, but he drenches himself in water and dissipates the flame spiral; soon before Midoriya comes in with an attack using his Shoot Style while the other students save the last victims from the wreckage, marking the end of the Provisional License Exam.
