As both students enter Eri's room, a nurse is concerned that Eri may lose control of her Quirk if something makes her remember the incident, but the doctor assures her that with Eri's current status it is unlikely that this will happen. Eri starts the conversation asking Izuku because he doesn't know him despite having saved her. Izuku informs her of both his real and hero names. Then, Eri blames herself for all the trouble that they and Sir Nighteye - who she is unaware that he has passed away - went through in their battle against Overhaul. Mirio reassures her it's not her fault, and they just wanted to see her smile again. Eri tries to smile, but it turns out that she can't even force herself to do it. Izuku is aware that even though Eri has been freed from Overhaul's shadowy clutches, she still sustained a lot of psychological damage. Thinking about the way she can smile again, he remembers Yuga's words about surprises and then asks Aizawa if it would be possible for Eri to attend the U.A. School Festival. When Eri asks what a festival is, Mirio explains that it is a place full of fun and joy, where she can eat delicious things like candy apples, which catches Eri's attention. Aizawa agrees with Izuku’s idea and phones to talk it over with Principal Nezu. Meanwhile, a villain named Gentle Criminal and his subordinate, La Brava, are searching for a scheme that will put his name down in the annals of history.</td>

As the rest of the audience cheer on, Kyoka thinks back to when she told her parents that she wants to be a hero instead of pursuing music full-time like them. Her parents were very accepting of her decision and told her to just do what she wants. The performance is loved by all, including Eri, whose smile finally returns. At the end of the festival, Izuku surprises Eri with a candy apple, much to her delight.
